Discussion
==========

- Framework-based SSG (JavaScript), eg [Next, Nuxt](https://ssg-build-performance-tests.netlify.app/), are not listed (commented out in README) 
- We cannot list [Antora from Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/antora/antora), our URL system is for Github
- Tone of voice and why this is exciting - for the writeup.
