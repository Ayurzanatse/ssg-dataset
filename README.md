# Popularity of static site generators

Static site generators are tools to create documentation, blogs and landing pages.

This repo contains Github data (stars, forks, issues, create and last modified dates) for 40+ popular open source static site generators (SSG) and the code to create the dataset. There is also a Streamlit app and a Google Colab notebook to explore the dataset.

## Motivation

Why is this data interesting? It helps to dig into the following:

- Which programming languages used to write static site generator (SSG) projects?
- Why people are building new stuff in a field where there are dominant projects?
- What drives a SSG adoption by users?
- Who are SSG project maintainers and what is their motivation?
- What makes a SSG project a success and why it might fail?
- Are well-designed themes more important than a SSG engine?

In the aftermath I am sharing thoughts on [picking the right tool for your own project](https://ssg-dataset.streamlit.app/My_favorites) based on SSGs and themes I tried for myself.

## Try live on Streamlit

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)][st]

[Streamlit app][st] lays out a data story about SSGs with several visualisations.

### Google Colab

[![Demo in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Open-orange)][colab]

[Colab][colab] is a try-and-see playground with some code for charts.

## Dataset

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4429834.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4429834)

[url]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epogrebnyak/ssg-dataset/main/data/ssg.csv

The stable URL for dataset is <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epogrebnyak/ssg-dataset/main/data/ssg.csv>

To download:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/"
       "epogrebnyak/ssg-dataset/main/data/ssg.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(url, parse_dates=["created", "modified"])
```

## How to update dataset

### Get a Github token

You will need a Github token to retrieve stats for many repos. Write out `.config.env`
near to where you run your Python code:

```toml
GH_USER="your Github username here"
GH_TOKEN="your Github personal token here"
```

Your Github personal token is [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/) and
token documentation is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

### Update CSV file

[yaml]: https://github.com/epogrebnyak/ssg-dataset/blob/main/data/ssg.yaml

The CSV file is generated from a list of Github repos grouped by programming language.
This repo list is stored in a [YAML][yaml] file in the following format:

```yaml
Go:
  - gohugoio/hugo
JavaScript:
  - gatsbyjs/gatsby
  - hexojs/hexo
  - vuejs/vuepress
Python:
  - mkdocs/mkdocs
  - getpelican/pelican
  - sphinx-doc/sphinx
```

Use `ssg.yaml_to_csv()` to update CSV file:

```python
from ssg import yaml_to_csv

yaml_to_csv("data/ssg.yaml", "data/ssg.csv")
```

[update]: https://github.com/epogrebnyak/ssg-dataset/blob/main/example/update.py

You can also run [`example/update.py`][update] to make new `data/ssg.csv`:

```
poetry run python example/update.py
```

The `update.py` script will also writes `metadata.json` file.

## Adding more SSGs to dataset

You can make a PR to update SSG list, just add a new line to [YAML file][yaml].
